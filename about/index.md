Jennifer has been living in Melbourne since 2018, when she completed her Honours year in Mathematics. Her research project, *Hadamard matrices and their generalisations*, involved writing C++ code to search for mathematical sets with specific properties. She has worked as a Software Developer in several different roles, most recently as a web developer at Seer Medical.

Prior to her career as a Software Developer, Jennifer taught Mathematics and Computer Science to senior secondary students. She has also worked as a Teaching Associate at Monash University, where she tutored and assessed units in Mathematics and Engineering.
