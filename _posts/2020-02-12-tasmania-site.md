I was recently reading about parallax scrolling effects on websites, so I decided to have a go at making one. The subject of my site was Tasmania, the beautiful state I grew up in.

The basic premise of parallax scrolling is straightforward. The image is set as a background image, and given a specific height. You can then use `background-attachment: fixed;` to achieve the desired effect. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JttTcnidSdQ&index=11&list=PLillGF-RfqbZTASqIqdvm1R5mLrQq79CU) by Traversy Media for a walkthrough. Note that the parallax effect can encounter performance problems on tablets mobile devices, so it may be necessary to use media queries to disable it at smaller screen sizes.

That's it really! [Click here](https://jenniferanneaus.github.io/tasmania/) to check out the website and learn about Tasmania. To read the source code, visit [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/jenniferanneaus/tasmania).
